# Mask-Detection
- Tasked to detect a person is wearing a mask or not
   in a Live video.                                                                      
- In this, I used OpenCV library to capture and process 
images and keras library to apply Convolutional   
neural network.                                                                
- I used Haarcascade classifier to Detect the face in        
the Live Video.
